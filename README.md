# PyBer Analysis Challenge
Analyzing and visualizing rideshare data with Python in Jupyter Notebook. 
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to analyze data for the company PyBer to better understand ridership and fare metrics of specific city types. By visualizing this data we are better able to understand why certain cities see increases in fares at certain times of the year along with other factors. 
## Results
The picture below sums up the difference between all three city types perfectly.

This summary shows us a couple things. We can conclude from this summary chart:
* Rural cities have the least amount of drivers available as well as riders. 
* Urban cities have the most amount of drivers available as well as riders. 
* Rural cities have the highest average fare per driver as well as lowest average fare per ride.
* Urban cities have the lowest average fare per driver as well as lowest average fare per ride.
* It appears as total drivers goes up, so does total fare revenue. 

## Summary
Based off of the results of this analysis, i would primarily focus on the needs of the rural areas for PyBer. Since revenue is much lower in rural areas compared to urban areas, this is a potential area of the business that could see growth. The data shows that the more drivers there are, revenue increases. I recommend adding more drivers in rural areas so that we can see an increase in fares. Sinces average fares per ride are highest in rural areas, this is a great opportunity to increase revenue. Based off of the line chart we created, it would be best to have more drivers available beginning by April since this is when we see an increase in fare revenue. The last recommendation would be to have less drivers available during the month of January since revenue drops during this period.
